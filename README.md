# JavaForTesters

This is the Udemy Course on [Java for Testers](https://softtek.udemy.com/course/java-for-testers-dmitry/) by Dmitry Shyshkin.

## List of codes by section or Project

### MyFirsJavaProject
#### Section 3 - Hello World project
1. **HelloWorld** - main method
   

#### Section 4 - Data Types

2. **Variables** - DATA TYPES (Primitive / Non-Primitive)
2. **DataTypesDemo** - Primitive Data Type CASTING - Widening & Narrowing
3. **MyString** - NON - Primitive Data Types (Strings)
4. **MyArray** - Non-Primitive - Arrays


#### Section 5 - Java Basics

6. Operators - Perform operations on Variables and Values.
2. IfElseDemo - IF > ELSE IF > ELSE
3. SwitchDemo - IF with powers. Look for a SPECIFIC condition, and DO only that.
4. Homework1 - Assignment to use IF statements.
5. Homework1Sol - Solution to assignment.
6. Homework2 - Assignment on SWITCH statement.
7. ForLoop - Executes a code for a Specific amount of times
8. `WhileLoop` - Executes a code IF or UNTIL a condition is met, for an undetermined amount of times. Risk of infinite Loops. 
9. `BreakAndContinue` - Skips an iteration, for some reason.
10. `TryCatch` - We can 'handle' **_exception_**, recognize it, and move on with the rest of the code.
11. `Homework3` - Count descendent from 50 to 0m in steps of 5.
12. `Homework4` - Replace letter 'o' for a ZERO '0' in the String 'Hello World!'.
13. `JavaMethods1` - Create and instantiate methods, from MAIN method.
14. `JavaMethodsFull` - Whole set of examples
15. `Homework5` - Print the average of three numbers.

### MyJavaOOP

#### Section 7 - Java OOP

21. `Main0` - The **_MAIN_** Class from where we instantiate the method from 'ClassDemo0' Class.
22. `ClassDemo0` - Set an integer variable, has a method `printNumber` print the value of that variable.
23. `LampPrivate` - Set a PRIVATE boolean variable, has an `public` IF method to print messages depending on boolean 
    value.
24. `LampPublic` - has the same boolean variable, but PUBLIC
25. `Main1` - Create 4 objects, from 'LampPublic' and 'LampPrivate', since instantiated objects are independent, we 
    managed to change ONE local variable boolean status. The one from the Public class of course.




## Section 1 & 2 - Install JAVA JDK 

I recommend start from the beginning, by installing the JDK on Windows.

To do so, star by reading the contents in the '`Setup JAVA on Windows`' folder.

Good Luck, see you on our **Hello World!** lecture.

## Section 3 - Hello World project

- We created a project named `MyFirstJavaProject` and understood the `main` method.
Created the `HelloWorld` code. 

## Section 4 - Data Types

- Learn about Data Types in `Variables` code.
- Learned the concepts of:
  - Declare
  - Initialize
    - Declare & Initialize in same code line.
  - Instance


- Practice Data Type **CASTING** on `DataTypesDemo`


- Practice with NON-Primitive Data Types
`MyString`
  - We learned how to concatenate Strings and even integers in a single line.
  - Also, String is a CLASS itself, we can cast methods

- - Practice with NON-Primitive Data Types
`MyArray`
  - Learned about Data Type Declare of our Array, with square brackets.
  - Learned about Indexes in JAVA, start at ZERO.
  - Learned about the limitations of `ARRAY` ( non dynamic) vs `ARRAYLIST` (maybe can add some more values).

## Section 5 - Java Basics

`Operators` Are used to perform operations on Variables and Values.

1. Arithmetical Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Logical Operators

`IfElseDemo`

- Example of IF conditional loop.
  - If is sequential, whenever a condition is `NOT` fulfilled it jumps to the immediate next one.

`SwitchDemo`

- IF statement with superpowers.
- It only executes the code that fulfills the stated condition.
- Faster than IF, since it acknowledge condition since the beginning, not one by one.
- In the case of `input` doesn't match any condition, we can set a `default` response.

`Homework1` - Assignment to use IF statements.

`Homework1Sol` - Solution to assignment.

`Homework2` - Assignment on SWITCH statement.

`ForLoop` - 

`WhileLoop` 

Here we have two versions
1. While - Check for the condition, then executes the code as long as condition is fulfilled, not a specific amount.
2. DO While - FIRST Executes the code, THEN checks for the condition status if you need to continue the loop.

`BreakAndContinue` - Break is used to STOP iterations. Continue skips a specific iteration, and move on.

`TryCatch` - We can 'handle' **_exception_**, recognize it, and move on with the rest of the code.

`Homework3` - Count descendent from 50 to 0m in steps of 5.

`Homework4` - Replace letter 'o' for a ZERO '0' in the String 'Hello World!'.

## Section 6 - Java Methods

`JavaMethods1` - Create and instantiate methods, from MAIN method.

`JavaMethodsFull` - Whole set of examples of Methods.
- Parameter (arguments)
- Overloading (Same name, different set of data types)
- Return type (not VOID method, actually a declared data type for outcome)

`Homework5` - Print the average of three numbers.

## Section 7 - Object Oriented Programming
